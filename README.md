# üöÄ Mitimes Developer Assessment Submission

Welcome to my technical submission for the **Senior Developer** role at [Mitimes](https://au.mitimes.com/) üëã  
This project demonstrates API interaction, async control flow, and clean, modern JavaScript (Node.js) development ‚Äî all designed with simplicity, clarity, and performance in mind.

## üß© Assessment Requirements

‚úÖ Command-line executable project  
‚úÖ Fetches secret token from `https://au.mitimes.com/careers/apply/secret`  
‚úÖ Sends authorized POST request to `https://au.mitimes.com/careers/apply`  
‚úÖ Uses `Authorization` header with secret token  
‚úÖ Posts a JSON body with `name`, `email`, `job_title`, etc.  
‚úÖ Logs response status & body to the console

### üß™ Optional Enhancements (Also Addressed)

‚úÖ Include `final_attempt: true` in the final POST payload  
‚úÖ Add an `extra_information` object with fields like:
- `skills`
- `experience`

> Ensure you have **Node.js v18 or higher** installed, which includes native `fetch` support.

### üßë‚Äçüíª Clone this repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Karan-21/Mitimes-Assessment.git
cd Mitimes-Assessment
```

### üìÇ File structure

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md      # This file üìù
```

### üöÄ Run the script
```bash
node main.js
```

### ‚úÖ Output
You will see output like:
```bash
=> Before Final Submission: -
Status Code: 201
Response Body:
 {
  message: "Nice work! Just remember to add 'final_attempt': true to complete :)",
  received: true,
  status_code: 201
}

=> After Final Submission: -
Status Code: 201
Response Body:
{
  message: 'Thanks! Keep an eye on karngupta21@gmail.com inbox for an email from us :)',
  received: true,
  status_code: 201
}
```

## ‚ú® Code Highlights

### üîÑ 1. Fetch Wrapper Utility
A reusable function that wraps the fetch API. It simplifies HTTP calls by handling method, headers, and body formatting. Helps avoid repetition and keeps the code clean and modular.

```js
async function fetchRequest(url, { method = 'GET', data, headers = {} } = {}) {
  ...
}
```

### üîê 2. Retrieve Secret Token
Sends a GET request to the secret URL to fetch the required Authorization token. This token is then used to authenticate the main application POST request.

```js
const secretResponse = await fetchRequest(`${BASE_URL}/apply/secret`);
const token = secretResponse.result;
```

### üì§ 3. Prepare Application Payload
Defines the JSON body of the POST request with required applicant fields. This simulates submitting real application data to the Mitimes API.

```js
const payload = {
            name: "Karan Gupta",
            email: "karngupta21@gmail.com",
            job_title: "Senior Full Stack Software Engineer",
            final_attempt: true,
            extra_information: {
                why_hire_me: "With 4+ years full-stack experience and leadership skills, I have a proven track record of delivering robust applications that enhance user experience and drive business growth. My expertise in modern web technologies, coupled with a strong foundation in DevOps, positions me to make significant contributions to Mitimes mission of transforming legal timekeeping with innovative technology, fostering a healthy, productive workplace.",
                technical_skills: [
                "JavaScript", "Node.js", "React", "TypeScript",
                "Docker", "CI/CD", "AWS", "PostgreSQL", "GitLab",
                "REST APIs", "Testing with Jest and Cypress"
                ],
                leadership_experience: "Experienced in mentoring, code reviews, and leading technical direction in agile teams.",
                communication: "Strong communicator bridging developers and product management to deliver user-first solutions.",
                work_style: "Proactive team player, quick learner of new technologies, thrives in fast-paced, cross-functional environments.",
                motivation: "Passionate about building clean, maintainable, and scalable software that improves productivity and wellbeing."
            }
};
```

### üìÆ 4. Submit Application Request
Posts the application data to the careers endpoint with the token in the Authorization header. Handles both the method and body in a clean, readable format.

```js
const applyResponse = await fetchRequest(`${BASE_URL}/apply`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { Authorization: token },
  data: payload
});
```

### üìã 5. Output Results to Console
Prints the server's response to the terminal ‚Äî including the status and body ‚Äî so the developer (or reviewer) gets instant feedback on the submission outcome.

```js
console.log(`Status Code: ${applyResponse.status_code}`);
console.log(`Response Body:\n`, applyResponse);
```
